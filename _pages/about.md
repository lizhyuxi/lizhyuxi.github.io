[**Crowd counting model based on CNN and Transformer**](http://lizhyuxi.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)
**Zhiyu Liu**, Yongqing Qu

- Supervised by [Prof. Mark Vogelsberger](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mark-vogelsberger/) from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) was used to tackle the crowd counting issue. 
- CNN do well in local feature extraction, while ViT's attention mechanism is ideal for global feature extraction. Our approach using integration presents a btter performance than the original CNN model.
