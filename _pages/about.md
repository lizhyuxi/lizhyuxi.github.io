[**Crowd counting model based on CNN and Transformer**](http://lizhyuxi.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)
Time: Accepted by **CEIP 2023**, not published yet
Author: **Zhiyu Liu**, Yongqing Qu

- Supervised by [Prof. Mark Vogelsberger](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mark-vogelsberger/) from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) was used to tackle the crowd counting issue. 
- CNN is good at local feature extraction, while ViT's attention mechanism is ideal for global feature extraction. Our approach: their integration presents a btter performance than the original CNN model.
