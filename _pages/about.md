Welcome to my personal website, where I share my passion and expertise in CS related fields.
# üí¨ About Me
I am a first-year [Master of Engineering](https://www.meng.ucla.edu/) student at [UCLA Samueli School of Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) and a graduate of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) from the [ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology](https://speit.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, natural language processing, and large language models.

You can find my CV here: [Zhiyu Liu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

[**Crowd counting model based on CNN and Transformer**](http://lizhyuxi.github.io/images/CNN.pdf)
  
**Zhiyu Liu**, Yongqing Qu

- Supervised by [Prof. Mark Vogelsberger](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mark-vogelsberger/) from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) was used to tackle the crowd counting issue. 
- CNN do well in local feature extraction, while ViT's attention mechanism is ideal for global feature extraction. Our approach using integration presents a better performance than the original CNN model.

[**Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing based on Incremental Learning**](http://lizhyuxi.github.io/images/SRSE2024.pdf)
  
**Zhiyu Liu**, Zhiyi Zhang, Mohamed Sallak, Siqi Qiu*

- My graduation thesis, supervised by [Prof. Siqi Qiu](https://speit.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/17), proposes a VMD-enhanced incremental learning model to improve fault diagnosis in rolling bearings.
- By addressing catastrophic forgetting and enhancing diagnostic accuracy, it provides an adaptable solution for evolving fault patterns in industrial environments.
